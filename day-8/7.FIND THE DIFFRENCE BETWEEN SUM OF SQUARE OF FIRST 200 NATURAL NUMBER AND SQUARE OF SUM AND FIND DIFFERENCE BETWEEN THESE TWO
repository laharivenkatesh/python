FIND THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN SUM OF SQUARE OF FIRST 200 NATURAL NUMBER AND SQUARE OF SUM AND FIND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
 program:

def sum_of_squares(n):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(1, n + 1))

def square_of_sum(n):
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))**2

n = 200
difference = square_of_sum(n) - sum_of_squares(n)
print(difference)

Output:

401323300
