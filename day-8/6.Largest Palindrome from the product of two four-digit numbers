Largest Palindrome from the product of two four-digit numbers
 program:
 
def is_palindrome(number):
    s = str(number)
    return s == s[::-1]
def product_and_check():
    num1 = 9999
    num2 = 9991
     product = num1 * num2
    if is_palindrome(product):
        return product
    else:
        return None
result = product_and_check()
if result:
    print(f"The product of 9999 and 9991 is {result}, and it is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The product is not a palindrome.")

    output:

    is a palindrome
